# Description

We have seen so far what React is and what it is capable of. To summarise in brief we got to know what React web-apps are, React Components, Props, States and lifecycle of a React component. We also created a basic clock application using all of the following. But React is a javascript library to build flexible User Interfaces, and we have not created any so far. So it is time for us to step into the real world of React by creating a simple yet impactful project.

# Task

Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!

We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file

For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit directory and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit file(s).

No more than 1 components per file. Additionals components will be in src/components/

CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.

On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.
